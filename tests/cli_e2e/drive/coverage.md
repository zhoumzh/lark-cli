# Drive CLI E2E Coverage

## Metrics
- Denominator: 29 leaf commands
- Covered: 2
- Coverage: 6.9%

## Summary
- TestDrive_FilesCreateFolderWorkflow: proves `drive files create_folder` in `create_folder as bot`; helper asserts the returned folder token and registers best-effort cleanup via `drive files delete`.
- TestDrive_ApplyPermissionDryRun / TestDrive_ApplyPermissionDryRunRejectsFullAccess: dry-run coverage for `drive +apply-permission`; asserts URL→type inference for docx/sheet/slides, explicit `--type` overriding URL inference when both a recognized URL and `--type` are supplied, bare-token + explicit `--type` path, request method/URL/type-query/perm/remark body shape, optional `remark` omission when unset, and client-side rejection of `--perm full_access`. Runs without hitting the live API.
- Cleanup note: `drive files delete` is only exercised in cleanup and is intentionally left uncovered.
- Blocked area: upload, export, comment, subscription, and reply flows still need deterministic remote fixtures and filesystem setup. Permission flows are partially covered via the dry-run test for `+apply-permission`; the full permission.members.* API surface remains uncovered.
